# INTRODUCTION 
 In the ever-evolving landscape of digital documentation, Portable Document Format (PDF) files stand as pillars of information storage, containing a wealth of data in a standardized format. The toolkit empowers users to query, discuss, and explore PDF content in a conversational manner, bridging the gap between traditional document analysis and intuitive, user-friendly interfaces. This project integrates cutting-edge technologies, most notably the OpenAI API, to empower users to engage in conversations with their PDF documents.
OCR, which stands for Optical Character Recognition, is a powerful technology used to extract text embedded within images.

# PROPOSED SYSTEM
 It Uses to extract Images , Links ,Meta Data and Make PDF Password Protected. It allow you to interact with PDF files using natural language and Extract Images , Links in a Same Module.The userâ€™s can extract information from various files types includes various file types which includes TXT , DOCX , XLSV , CSV and make conversation with these files are possible using this toolkit. OCR,which stands for Optical Character Recognition, is a powerful technology used to extract text embedded within images.

# CONCLUSION
 The modern AI technologies have greatly expanded our ability to analyze and extract valuable insights from large volumes of text data, such as books or documents. Through the use of tools like OpenAI, LangChain, and Pinecone, we can perform sophisticated searches on this data, allowing us to quickly and efficiently find the information we need. Additionally, by chunking the data into smaller, more manageable pieces, we can provide contextual information to AI models, improving their ability to process and analyze the information we present to them.In this project, we created a tool that can do a lot with PDF files. It can pull out text, images, metadata (like who made the PDF and when), and links. It allows users to pose questions, seek information, and engage in a natural language dialogue with the content extracted from PDF documents.This project proposes a novel Python toolkit that empowers conversations with PDFs. It leverages the capabilities of several Python libraries to extract text, images, and links from PDFs, and integrates with the OpenAI API to generate conversation prompts or responses based on the extracted information.Although this report provides a successful experimental system for question answering, building a high-performance and robust system that can cater to a wide range of use cases and deliver improved accuracy and reasoning power requires the expertise of seasoned system developers like us.This focus on accessibility and explainability will broaden the project's reach and foster trust in its capabilities. Users will feel more empowered to engage with the toolkit and gain valuable insights from their PDF documents.
